Please Note:
This repo is not fully complete, I still have a few files to track down and add.
For this reason, the code may not be fully functional or may contain some innacurate information.

Not all of the code is mine, some of it was given as part of assignment criteria.
However, I coded the majority of the actual searching algorithms.
More code annotation to distinguish the parts that I created will be made in the near future.
